                <h2>UX Research</h2>                                  
                
                 The United States Tennis Association (USTA) wanted us to create new platform to engage today’s youth with tennis. Instead of the ask being centered around a website or app, USTA wanted us to come up with a new voice for a faceless brand. At the time of the ask, sign ups weren’t even open for the youth audience they wanted to target. All they had was a vague website and the knowledge that they wanted to create a more welcoming space for the new generation of children coming into the sport.
     
            <br></br>
     
                For USTA Net Generation, there wasn’t much of an existing platform. Still, by looking at its target demographics, I looked at potential comparative and competitive brands and created this <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fopen%3Fid%3D0B56n7ylCB0CbdVF6MXY2cG56UEE">landscape audit</a> to help guide the rest of the creative team. The audit did not inform what needed to be included in our final platform, but just what trends and baselines exist currently.

            <br></br><br></br>
        
                As a side project while strategy was underway, I completed this site map of the Australia Tennis youth engagement program, in order to understand a little more of the mechanisms behind a different countries approach to youth tennis. My key takeaways here were centered around the fact that a skeletal site map can really tell you a lot about an execution of a concept. Australia Tennis focused its entire system around this match making system, shown through the main component of its website — the map based coach/partner/program finder.

        <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fSVW58K5M_AFhw5QbAXVrQ.png">
        
        <BR></BR><br></br>
        
            In an effort to understand the target audiences, millennial parents and their kids, I began researching general demographic cohorts to see what trends existed beyond just my stigmas. After doing so and coming up with a self reference chart, I realized it might be beneficial to hear stories coming straight from them. I took initiative to conduct our own internal focus groups within the agency in New York City (USTA was already conducting external focus groups on their own).
        
        <br></br>

            <h2>Reframe</h2>
    
            The first thing we tackled was taking the client ask and reframing into something that could inspire our work further. In a way, we were taking what they told us they wanted, and reframing it into something more targeted and actionable for us.

        <br></br>

            The told us: “We are looking for engaging tactics on how to best engage our new brand with registered Net Generation participants.” 
        <br></br>
            We isolated the main reason they were looking to re-engage the new brand with children: Kids succumb to the intense pressure of winning in sports and ultimately drop out because they find no room for casual play.
        <br></br>
            Our key insight, from data scraping and user research, was that: Kids need to define their own success.
        <br></br>
            Our final token idea to lead into our conceptual work: <b>Make this game your own</b>.
        <br></br>
            
            <h2>Concepting</h2>

            From the reframe, we began to dig deeper into trying to find a higher concept to work under. Our main goal was to understand the three demographics at play - the players, the parents, and the providers (coaches). We created numerous affinity maps (like the one below) amongst other forms of conceptual play.
        <br></br><br></br>

        <br></br><br></br>

    <Br></Br>
        <h2> Manifesto Ideation </h2>

        From the concepting stage came the stage for more concrete ideation. As Wunderman is advertisement focused design agency, we followed the ad-centric flow for this, coming up with a concept manifesto and tagline, after many iterations:

        <BR></BR><BR></BR>
                <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*EVS271CUYtglld6DwdwvFw.png">
        <br></br><BR></BR>

        It was at this point that I realised copywriting was definitely something I could improve on, but in the end we settled on the following manifesto:
        <br></br><BR></BR>
        <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*e9HNv8iLlYtqtNaJwrycUg.png">
        <br></br><BR></BR>

       <b>Our concept was that: “Every stroke makes you a masterpiece” — the idea that a player’s tennis journey and identity should be celebrated, no matter the technical ability.</b>

    <BR></BR>
    <h2>Executions</h2>

    One idea we came up with centralized around some form of curating their story for them — a kiosk by public USTA tennis courts that was fun to interact with, but would also eventually store their own personal tennis over years of interaction.
    <BR></BR>
    We liked the abstract idea behind this but also needed to come up with a concrete execution for how the “storage” and the “story” would come to life. One initial idea was for the kiosks to have “fun questions” with easy answers like emojis or pictures. The story would be more abstracted, perhaps a portrait of the player over time comprised of the data points, and living in a web app connected to each kid’s Net Generation account.
    <BR></BR>
    The need for a visual identity also arose at this point, which were drafted on in numerous iterations.
    <BR></BR>
    In parallel with the visual identity was the need for an understanding of the user journey, which I focused on. With different secondary demographics, the focus was on the players (kids 5–18, but especially at the “tween” age). I started with rough personas:
    <BR></BR>

    <i>Jax is a thirteen-year old male who plays tennis every Tuesday and Thursday after school. He attends a public school in the middle of San Francisco. He started tennis after his move two years ago to get to meet kids in the area. However, the structure of classes at the local club means he’s actually only playing with younger players. He doesn’t mind, but part of him wants to focus on his other sport — basketball — that he can play with people his own age.
        <BR></BR>
    Kylie is a fourteen-year old female who has daily tennis practice with her private school’s team. She has lived in the outskirts of Boston all her life, and grew up playing on the courts of the local community centers. While tennis has been a big part of her upbringing, the competitive nature of her team makes her look less and less forward to each match. She often times complains over Snapchat & Facebook of the long hours and icing of sore muscles.</i>


    <BR></BR>
    With the personas in mind, I created an overarching journey map for the entire concept:
    
        <br></br><BR></BR>

        <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Mf6rziKZkg5EMxY6Poa2gg.png">
         <br></br><BR></BR>

    To execute smaller aspects of the map, I also then began to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KlSOQhrjAHrJJ-GZiWEBBKJqx2_nO3AWACsxXz6WAgY/edit?usp=sharing">prototype low-fidelity screen flows</a> to highlight the potential kiosk experience:

    <br></br><BR></BR>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5g3ri5-SDoejFHznPMd1yQ.png">
    <br></br><BR></BR>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kQWtRp6PWDS3d4_M_LVH2Q.png">
    <br></br><BR></BR>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0ZEhp8smXHuFZH3Vibtxhg.png">
    <br></br><BR></BR>

    At this point, I'm in the process of fleshing out the entire ecosystem and creating numerous wireframes for all touchpoints. In addition to the out-of-home experience shown by the wireframes, I've also been working on aspects such as a peer-mentoring system, player matchups, and so on. The entire system should be fleshed out by mid-August!

                <h1>How might we improve communication between families and physicians in the intensive care unit of hospitals?</h1>
                
                <h2>Background </h2>
                 The Intensive Care Unit is a high stress environment for the physicians, patients, and families there. The focus of this project was on alleviating the stress between families and physicians. The main stress points are often lack of onboarding into the ICU environment, the negative stigma of the ICU, and inconsistent information updates between physician and family members of a patient.
                
                <h2>Research</h2>
                I worked with a research partner to uncover these stress points with physicians and family members in the ICU. We piggybacked off of existing research (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27037049">"Key stakeholders' perceptions of the acceptability and usefulness of a tablet-based tool to improve communication and shared decision making in ICUs", Ernecoff 2016</a>) by conducting interviews over the course of a few months, talking to a variety of people that go through the ICU. A lot of the interviews focused on a first level prototype created by UPMC / CMU HCII that targeted the initial paint points, and we were looking to improve upon this first prototype as well as make sure it was solving the issues in the first place.

                 <BR></BR> 
                <h2>Deliverables</h2>
                Our final deliverable was a prototype that improved on pain points noted from the user interviews. We focused mostly on improving user flow in the onboarding process as well as creating a whole new section for better communication back and forth between families and physicians, utilizing an improved "family meetings" ecosystem.
