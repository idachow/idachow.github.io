                            Online gift giving brings up thoughts of e-certificates, reused e-cards, and a touch of "this was easy and fast, here you go". On one hand, they are fast and immediate, but on the other hand they can come off as impersonal. We aimed to better this downfall of digital gifting with a new mobile application idea.<BR></BR>
                            We wanted to bridge this gap by creating a more nuanced gift giving app on the mobile platform, utilizing current technology and building off of experiences of our peers.<BR></BR>

                            We wanted to create an app that especially caters towards those who normally would be gifting each other in person - mother & daughter, husband & wife, or any other pair that may for the time-being be apart. The intimacy of the app is not geared towards hundreds of Facebook friends, but just a few loved ones.

                            The idea behind the app is that one can send a loved one an immediate gift in their vicinity - such as a local cupcake shop - where partnered stores will then present the gift to the loved one with a gift - eliminating the need for vouchers and directly monetary gifts. Instead, the loved one will be greated warmly and be given a gift straight from thier mother, boyfriend, wife, mentor, or so on. The proximity of the gift gives a spontaneous and intimate feel to the gift, which again sets it apart from your average digital gift.

The intimacy of the app is not geared towards hundreds of Facebook friends, but just a few loved ones. Once the gift has been sent, the recipient then will get a notification that leads them to their gift.</a>

                       In creating this app, we interviewed those who had been giving e-gifts before, as well as created numerous scenarios while trying to figure out a target audience for the application. In the end we came up with storyboards that showcased the spontaneous nature of the app that works with what is in your proximity to find the right gift for each recipient.

                       In the end, we felt that we were able to appropriately fill a gap in the digital gifting world, with an application that extended beyond the confines of the phone into more of a world of IOT, where human interactions are aided and guided by a mobile interface. Throughout the process, it was important to keep in mind the environment and situations users would be in. Beyond the design of the actual application, there was a lot of design work put into designing situations and experiences outside of the screen.
