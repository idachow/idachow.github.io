    <h2>reflecting on my asian-american identity</h2>

        “Asked to write about ECAASU; didn’t quite do it”</P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><i>ECAASU is the annual East Coast Asian American Student Union Conference, and this year it was at Rutgers in East Brunswick, New Jersey. I attended the conference a long with a couple of other students from Carnegie Mellon students to participate in the discussion on AAPA identity in the modern American world.</i> </p>
    
    <P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Playlist ready and bags in trunk, we begin our six-hour drive filled with laughter and eager conversation about the weekend to come. It’s all quite casual and laid-back, but our reasons for deciding to attend the East Coast Asian American Student Union conference at Rutgers stems from our own integral experiences as Asian-Americans within our own communities. 

<P>For myself, one big part of being East Asian-American I’ve come to question is our general silence. A familiar stereotype of East Asian population is that we are a model minority - something we take in silent stride. We keep to our books and our relative peace amidst other charged and popular topics like police brutality, immigration issues, the legality of marijuana, and celebrity drama. Such is the American life. In mainstream media like film and television, it’s hard to find familiar faces -- we are also underrepresented and quiet in that way. At the recent Academy Awards, there was some long overdue acknowledgement of the overlooking of minorities (#OscarsSoWhite did trend for a bit), but amidst even that was an absence of Asian presence only highlighted by the use of mildly offensive jokes backdropped by a few Asian-American children in their white collar worker regalia.

<P>It’s true that the jokes and stereotypes against East Asians may veer towards being less harmful in the grand scheme of discrimination, but I think there is something to be said about the way we discount it by walking faster and putting our headphones on. It’s unclear to know if we have a specific place in the spectrum of minorities and discrimination, or where that place may actually be. Even here at Carnegie Mellon, where we are all young and loud and - for the most part - liberal, our conversations are rare and hard to bring up. Is it awkward? Is it out of place? Is it just difficult? 

<P>These questions are instinctively mentally answered with a buzzword I’ve been struggling with: “privilege”. Do we have a minority privilege? ASA gave me the opportunity to sit at a dinner table with MLK keynote speaker Jelani Cobb, where I felt humbled by the people around me and their experiences and stories on race and the current state of it. I also felt that I personally did not have stories that would hold up to the honest and raw experiences that they had to share. One of Jelani’s thoughts stuck with me though - the need for more “public intellectuals” to represent the people they believe in.  We, as Asian-Americans, do have our own remarkable public intellectuals to look up to: George Takei, Ang Lee, Senator Mazie Hirono, author Celeste Ng, historian Ronald Takaki, and poet-activist Fong Tran.

<P>And to be honest, it was only after hearing about the Peter Liang case that I saw great importance in the specific Asian-American stance on social issues and discrimination. For all the things that our public intellectuals have been saying, this case was the trigger to the loudest I’ve ever personally heard the Asian-American demographic. To what purpose and end is unclear, with muddying and troubling issues of race at play, but at least discussion is starting. There is a lot to hear about this case, and many others, and deciding to go to ECAASU was a step towards breaking my own silence.

<P>Over the day of workshops, coffee, food, and wonderfully lovely vibes, I got to meet students from all over that have an interest in talking about all of these topics and more. Perhaps we all came with our own agendas, but there was something about the space for discourse that was essentially handed to us on a silver platter. I hope that the energy from ECAASU continues through those that attended, and that we can continue conversing with our own community here at Carnegie Mellon. 
    <P>I’m down if you’re down, let’s grab a cup of coffee.
