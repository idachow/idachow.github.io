                  <h3>USTA's Youth Brand</h3>
                  
                  USTA (United States Tennis Association) wanted us to create new platform to engage today’s youth with tennis. Instead of the ask being centered around a website or app, USTA wanted us to come up with a new voice for a faceless brand. At the time of the ask, sign ups weren’t even open for the youth audience they wanted to target. All they had was a vague website and the knowledge that they wanted to create a more welcoming space for the new generation of children coming into the sport.
                  
                  <h3>Initial Strategy from Team</h3>
                  
                  The first thing we tackled was taking the client ask and reframing into something that could inspire our work further. In a way, we were taking what they told us they wanted, and reframing it in a way to inspire our own work in a unique way.<BR><BR>
                  
                  They told us: “We are looking for engaging tactics on how to best engage our new brand with registered Net Generation participants.”<BR><BR>
                  
                  We isolated the main reason they were looking to re-engage the new brand with children: Kids succumb to the intense pressure of winning in sports and ultimately drop out because they find no room for casual play.<BR><BR>
                  
                  Our key insight, from data scraping and user research, was that: <b>Kids need to define their own success</b>. In order to be able to conceptually build on this, we centered around the concept of "<b>making the game your own"</b>.<BR><BR>

                  <h2>So let's start with the players</h2>
                  
                  
                <h3>They're ambitious and fearless</h3>
                  
                  Armed with smartphones and the internet, the kids that make up today's Generation Z are inquisitive and forward. As a whole, these kids are looking to find ownership and identity through their hobbies, and many have left traditional sports behind. How can we make an experience that targets them?
                  
                  
                <h3>Connect the sport of tennis with imagination and creativity</h3>
                  
                  We introduce the concept of the Launch Pad - the segue into a sport that is not traditional and dry, but really connects with a young child's imagination as they connect with the game. While on one hand the Launch Pad could be a physical waystation to make the interaction seamless and easy, there also other ways to DIY the experience, such as just using two binder clips and a phone.

                <h3>Give them something to own</h3>
                  
                  The culmination of the Launch Pad - whether a DIY object or an actual station - is mix of imagination and real play. Figments of a player's own imagination are added to site-specific elements to create one-of-a-kind shareable creations. The videos they create evolve over time, and are gamified in the sense that the more often they play in different courts all over, the more they can see their creations grow in complexity.

                  <h3>Use their creativity as an opportunity</h3>
                  
                  As the video takes time to render, players will also be asked to answer quick and easy questions that allow them to reflect on their game on and off the court. By tying in aspects of their tennis/social/family life into this hybrid experience, data can be used to enhance their personal USTA Net Generation experience.<BR><BR>

                  <h3>Everyone should stay in the loop</h3>
                  
                 The biggest reason for dropping out is that kids find no space for casual and supportive play in the currently competitive realm of tennis. By recommending and suggestinig the right frame of mind for both coaches and providers (such as parents), this can be avoided. <BR><BR>

                  Before each of their lessons, the coaches will recieve a deck of conversation cards and a "review of the week" to allow them to better connect with the students and players outside of their potential once a week lesson.<BR><BR>

                  </center> 
                  
                  After each lesson, the coaches will recieve a similar deck of conversation cards targeting parents they have not spoken to in awhile, keeping them in the loop - especially those that haven't been in touch in awhile.<BR><BR>

                  <h3>And the loop helps push everyone forward</h3>
                  
                  The emphasis on the coaches leading the way is intentional. Generation Z is individualistic, and want to be supported but not smothered by their parents. By having the coaches have the power to execute these relationships, the players and the providers will all be supported by someone who is to be the rock of their tennis journey<BR><BR>

                  Generation Z is on Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and Youtube. Targeting ads directly on these platforms is a clear way to reach them. In addition, these digital platforms allow us to play with interactivity and motion.

                  <h3>Landscape Audit</h3>
                  
                  Before starting on any actual ideation, we started with an exploration of the competitive landscape. By looking at potential competitors in all different spaces, we were able to see what trends currently existed in areas like digital education, fitness applications, youth mentorship programs, online gaming sites, youth social media, and so on. Through thorough analysis of a wide array of spaces, we were able to create a curated reference that we could refer to at any time, as we took note of trends and expectations in the lay of the land.
                  
                  
                  <h3>Site Map Analysis of Australia's Program</h3>
                  
                  Another exploration we started with was just the site map analysis of a similar program in another country - Australia. This was a clear way to continue off of the original Landscape Audit, and a way to see how the other program hierarchized and prioritized their program.
                  
                  <BR><BR>

                <BR><BR>
                    Their site map showed that their program was heavily centered around the ability for any player to find a coach for any level of play - casual or competitive. It was interesting to see how a site map could reveal such hierarchies, and showed how the Australian program seemed to be setting itself apart.
                  
                  
                  <h3>User Studies</h3>
                  
                  User studies were conducted in the homes of families with tennis playing youth and also on the courts and at out own office. In general, our findings are what were reflected in the strategy deliverables - that Generation Z is ambitious, fearless, and independent and that many drop out due to pressures to be competitve in the sport of tennis..<BR><BR>

                      <U>Jax is a thirteen-year old male who plays tennis every Tuesday and Thursday after school. He attends a public school in the middle of San Francisco. He started tennis after his move two years ago to get to meet kids in the area. However, the structure of classes at the local club means he’s actually only playing with younger players. He doesn’t mind, but part of him wants to focus on his other sport — basketball — that he can play with people his own age.</U>
                      <BR><BR>
                   <U> Kylie is a fourteen-year old female who has daily tennis practice with her private school’s team. She has lived in the outskirts of Boston all her life, and grew up playing on the courts of the local community centers. While tennis has been a big part of her upbringing, the competitive nature of her team makes her look less and less forward to each match. She often times complains over Snapchat & Facebook of the long hours and icing of sore muscles.</U>
                  
                  
                  
                  <h3>Early Exploration and Research</h3>
                  
                  We conducted a variety of concepting techniques to work towards our ideas, including affinity mapping, storyboard sketching, and acting out scenarios. Over time our ideas caught momentum, were scrapped, brought back to life, scrapped again, started over, and so on.<BR><BR>

                  <h3>Journey Maps</h3>
                  
                 Over more developed iterations we also came up with multiple journey maps to explain the users experience over the entire ecosystem. <BR><BR>
                                   
                                                  <center>

                  </center> 
                  
                  <h3>Alternate Iterations</h3>
                  
                 Additional visual identities were also explored in attempt to nail down the visual identity of our final product.<BR><BR>
                  
                 <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                  As we moved towards our final ideas, we also created many low and medium fidelity wireframes as prototypes for the digital experience of the users.<BR><BR>
