              <h2>Project Background</h2>
                  
                  <h3>The Intensive Care Unit</h3>
                  
                  Intensive care units cater to patients with severe and life-threatening illnesses and injuries, which require constant, close monitoring and support from specialist equipment and medications in order to ensure normal bodily functions. They are staffed by highly trained doctors and nurses who specialise in caring for critically ill patients. Essnetially, it is a high stress environment for the patient and families involved. How can a digital communication tool help diminish stress and onboard a family effectively?
                  
                  <h3>Previous Research</h3>
                  
                   The Carnegie Mellon University Human-Computer Interaction Institute and the University of PIttsburgh had previously been conducting research on the digital facilitation of communication between physicians and families. One such article highlights what aspects should be included in such a tool.<BR><BR>

                  <h2>User Studies</h2>
                  
                <h3>Original prototype</h3> 
                  
                  We were given the original prototype that executed many aspects from the research paper, but seemed to have many other shortcomings in other aspects. In order to truly examine what the issues were, we planned out our user tests. <BR><BR>

                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                  
                  Over the course of a few months, we interviewed common visitors of the UPMC intensive care unit, including physicians. We asked about their habits and comfort with the intensive care unit, and then did a walkthrough of the prototype, giving them different exploratory tasks.
                  
                  
                <h3>Qualitative summarization</h3>
                  
                   Overall, we found a few key points:
                  
                  <BR><BR>
                      
                     - Users wanted to feel responsiveness outside of just a tablet - if information was going in, they wanted to have feedback on that. Anything, like a real printed piece of paper, or acknowledgement from staff, would be welcome.
                      
                      - Forced video watching didn't help many users at all. Some ignored the educational videos, others looked to find a way to skip, and others did manage to find their way around it.
                      
                      - The desktop-first design of the first iteration of the prototype confused users on iPad, especially those who were already struggling with the tablet interface.

                  <h3>Sketches</h3>
                  
                 By going through a list of aspects we knew we wanted to fix through our new prototype, we began sketching out potential overall looks. <BR><BR>

                    <h3>Prototype</h3>
                  
                     We worked with the way videos were presented to include transcripts and summarizations of information. By emphasizing the tablet-first usage, we were able to come up with a clean and easy to navigate (by touch) interface. Lastly, We also wanted to prototype a new way to make the tablet feel more responsive in the context of the ICU by introducing a way to see what was submitted.<BR><BR>
